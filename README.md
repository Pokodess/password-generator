# Strong Password Generator in Python

I created a password generator using lists in Python.

### Theory

_1_. We put all existing characters into different lists.

_2_. We pick a number of random characters into each list.

_3_. We shuffle this new list of characters.

Now we have a password with each categories of characters ( special characters, numbers, lowercase and uppercase ).
We can choose the proportion of each categories in the final password.
